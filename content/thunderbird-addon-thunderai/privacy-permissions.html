<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>If you're using the ChatGPT web interface or the OpenAI integrations, this add-on connects with OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web interface, sending the prompt on user action, but it does not collect any data itself, other than settings stored locally.
<br>The text is sent to OpenAI's server only on user action and managed by their data retention policy.
