<h1>"ThunderAI" Thunderbird Addon Privacy & Permissions</h1>


<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>If you're using the ChatGPT web interface or the OpenAI integrations, this add-on connects with OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web interface, sending the prompt on user action, but it does not collect any data itself, other than settings stored locally.
<br>The text is sent to OpenAI's server only on user action and managed by their data retention policy.

    <ul>
        <li>OpenAI's privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a></li>
        <li>OpenAI's API data usage policy is here <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank">https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>If you're using the Ollama API integration, this add-on connects with the local Ollama instance you configured, sending the prompt on user action, and it does not collect any data itself, other than settings stored locally.</p>
<br>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>These are the permissions used by ThunderAI in Thunderbird.<br>
Remember that ThunderAI only operates based on user interaction; nothing is done without a direct user action within the add-on menu.</p>
