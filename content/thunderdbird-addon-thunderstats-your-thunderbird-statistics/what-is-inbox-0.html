Title = "What is Inbox 0?"

<p>Inbox Zero is a rigorous approach to email management aimed at keeping the inbox empty &ndash; or almost empty &ndash; at all times.</p>
<p>Inbox Zero was developed by productivity expert Merlin Mann. According to Mann, the zero is not a reference to the number of messages in an inbox; it is &ldquo;the amount of time an employee&rsquo;s brain is in his inbox.&rdquo;<br />Mann&rsquo;s point is that time and attention are finite and when an inbox is confused with a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list, productivity suffers.</p>
<p>Mann identifies five possible actions to take for each message: <em>delete</em>, <em>delegate</em>, <em>respond</em>, <em>defer</em> and <em>do.</em></p>
<p>Here are some of Mann&rsquo;s tips for effective email management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t leave the email client open.</li>
<li>Process email periodically throughout the day, perhaps at the top of each hour.</li>
<li>First delete or archive as many new messages as possible.</li>
<li>Then forward what can be best answered by someone else.</li>
<li>Immediately respond to any new messages that can be answered in two minutes or less.</li>
<li>Move new messages that require more than two minutes to answer &ndash; and messages that can be answered later &ndash; to a separate &ldquo;requires response&rdquo; folder.</li>
<li>Set aside time each day to respond to email in the &ldquo;requires response&rdquo; folder or chip away at mail in this folder throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
